        Description: `Snorkel Trails is a web app I built with another developer over two weeks as our capstone project at CodeClan. The idea was to create something useful, fun and outdoorsy - so we built a platform to help people discover snorkelling spots around Scotland.

                        The app lets users:
                        - Search for snorkel locations and filter by beach, amenities, skill level, and accessibility.
                        - Check the weather and tide conditions at each spot.
                        - Use an interactive map to explore locations visually.
                        - See what kinds of sea life live in each area

                        I focused mainly on the frontend functionality, while my teammate handled most of the backend work and data input for the sea life per location in Java. We collaborated closely on the design and styling, working together on the CSS to make sure everything looked and felt right.
                        We built the frontend with React, and the backend in Java. It was a great challenge balancing real-time data (like tide and weather APIs) with user-friendly filtering and map features.`,

        Description: `Mind Blank is a trivia quiz game created during a one-week group project with three other developers. The app allows users to choose from different categories and difficulty levels, making for a customisable and engaging quiz experience.
                        My main contribution was building the interactive timer bar - it gradually shrinks over time, giving visual feedback on how much time is left, and automatically ends the game when time runs out. I also spent a good portion of the project on debugging and polishing functionality, while other teammates focused on CSS styling and backend development.
                        The project was a great opportunity to collaborate as a team under time pressure and build a fast-paced, fun app.`,

        Title: "Who's That Pokémon?",
        Img: "",
        Description: `Who's That Pokémon? is a simple but fun guessing game I built over a weekend as part of a CodeClan homework assignment. The app shows an image of a Pokémon, and the player has to guess its name by typing it in.
                        If you're stuck, you can choose to skip to a new Pokémon or reveal the name. It’s a light-hearted app focused on quick interactions and a bit of nostalgia.
                        It was a great chance to practice working with user input, simple game logic, and state management in React aswell as api functions.`,
